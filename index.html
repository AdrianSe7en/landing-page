                  <p> <strong>What is Blockchain? </strong> </p>
                  <p>
                    At its core, a blockchain is a decentralized, distributed ledger technology. Think of it as a digital ledger that records transactions across a network of computers. Unlike traditional ledgers, which are centralized and controlled by a single entity, a blockchain operates in a decentralized manner, meaning no single authority has control over it.
                    
                    Each “block” in a blockchain contains a list of transactions. Once a block is filled with transaction data, it is appended to a chain of previous blocks, forming a continuous and immutable record of all transactions. This chain is maintained across a network of computers, known as nodes. Every node has a copy of the entire blockchain, ensuring that all participants have access to the same information.

                  <p><strong>Key Characteristics of Blockchain:</strong></p>
                  <p>
                    Decentralization: Unlike centralized databases, a blockchain is distributed across multiple nodes. This reduces the risk of single points of failure and increases security.
                    Immutability: Once data is recorded in a block and added to the blockchain, it cannot be altered or deleted. This immutability ensures the integrity and reliability of the data.
                    ransparency: All transactions are visible to participants in the network, promoting accountability and reducing the potential for fraud.
                    Consensus Mechanisms: Blockchain networks use various consensus mechanisms, such as Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS), to agree on the validity of transactions and the order in which they are added to the blockchain.

                    <p><strong> What is Cryptocurrency?</strong> </p>
                    <p>
                        Cryptocurrency is a type of digital or virtual currency that uses cryptography for security. The term “crypto” refers to the use of encryption techniques to secure transactions, control the creation of new units, and verify the transfer of assets.
                        </p>
                    <p>
                        Cryptocurrencies operate on blockchain technology, leveraging its decentralized nature to function without the need for traditional financial intermediaries, like banks or payment processors. Bitcoin, the first and most well-known cryptocurrency, was introduced in 2009 by an anonymous entity known as Satoshi Nakamoto. It remains the most prominent example, but thousands of other cryptocurrencies exist today, each with its own unique features and use cases.
